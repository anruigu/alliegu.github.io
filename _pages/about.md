Hello! I am a researcher in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu) at Berkeley AI Research, where I work on safe reinforcement learning and human-in-the-loop imitation learning, after graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science. Check out my [Data Science](https://github.com/data-science-era) and [Machine Learning/Robotics](https://github.com/ml-robotics-era) projects on Github, ranging from drone path planning to a production recommendation engine built from scratch. 

I'm actively job searching and would love to hear from you if you're hiring or just want to chat!

At Berkeley, I tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/) and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS.  I was a board member of the California China Summit, a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en), and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/).
