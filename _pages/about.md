Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer in Houston. I have a B.A. in Computer Science from Berkeley, where I did research in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu), tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/), and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland students in introductory CS. 

In Fall 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the [NYU Generalizable Robotics and AI Lab](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). Previously, I was a Generative AI engineer and consultant at startups specializing in LLM evaluation and embedding retrieval. I also built the core product recommendation engine at [FRH](https://thefrontrowhealth.com/).
