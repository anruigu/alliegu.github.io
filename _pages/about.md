Hello! I am a researcher in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu) at Berkeley AI Research after graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science. Check out my projects on GitHub in [Data Science](https://github.com/data-science-era) and [Machine Learning/Robotics](https://github.com/ml-robotics-era), ranging from drone path planning to a production recommendation engine built from scratch. 

At Berkeley, I tutored for [CS 182: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/). I [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS for a year.  I helped organize the California China Summit, was a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en), and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/).
