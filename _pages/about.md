Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer in Houston. I have a B.A. in Computer Science from Berkeley, where I did research in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu), tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/), and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS. 

I graduated the month ChatGPT came out. Naturally, I became a Generative AI engineer and consultant at early-stage startups, specializing in LLM evaluation and embedding retrieval. Previously, I built the core product recommendation engine at [FRH](https://thefrontrowhealth.com/).
