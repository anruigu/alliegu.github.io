Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer in Houston. I finished undergrad at Berkeley, where I did research in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu). 

I also tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/) and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS. I was a board member of the California China Summit, a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en), and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/).Â
