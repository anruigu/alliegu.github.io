Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer in NYC. I got a B.A. in Computer Science from Berkeley, where I worked on imitation learning for robotics in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu) at Berkeley AI Research. 

I also tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/) and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS.  I was a board member of the California China Summit, a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en), and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/). 

More projects can be found here: [Data Science](https://github.com/data-science-era) and [Machine Learning/Robotics](https://github.com/ml-robotics-era), ranging from drone path planning to a production recommendation engine built from scratch.
