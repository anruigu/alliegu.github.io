I finished undergrad at Berkeley, where I did research in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu), tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/), and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) underserved Oakland middle school students in introductory CS.
