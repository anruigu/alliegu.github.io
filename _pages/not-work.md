I grew up in Beijing and Los Angeles, where I did a lot of writing, interational exchange, and community advocacy. 

I switched to CS in order to become a better science fiction writer. For a fun read, check out my thesis on [science fiction films' religious critique of androids and capitalism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQ_1Kn-7BNHuzPLhZ3iB0iwZb9esrRF_aMzJKcUW-Dk/edit).

2024 update: 
Being a foreign national in the US is, as I have learned in the past year, like a triathlon for life. You have to strive to be exceptional and also somehow stay happy and healthy.

No advocacy tool I learned can fix the fact that I cannot live my life to the fullest, but I still try. I’ve seen this happen to the best of us over and over again. So if you’re also going through it, here’s an air hug <3
