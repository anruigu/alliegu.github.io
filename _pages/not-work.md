I grew up in Beijing and Los Angeles, where I was a writer, debater and community advocate. I also spent a lot of time on interational communication, serving as board member of the California China Summit and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/). I speak intermediate German and was a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en). 

I originally switched to CS in order to become a better science fiction writer. I strongly identify with my best characters: a fictional character (in my fiction!) that uses calligraphy to bring humans into existence, and a human imprisoned in a computer that spearheads the AI Consciousness Movement. 

For a fun read, check out my thesis on [science fiction films' religious critique of androids and capitalism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQ_1Kn-7BNHuzPLhZ3iB0iwZb9esrRF_aMzJKcUW-Dk/edit).
