I grew up in Beijing and Los Angeles, where I was a writer, debater and community advocate. I also spent a lot of time on interational communication, serving as board member of the California China Summit and a delegate to the [Forum for American-Chinese Exchange at Stanford](https://faces.stanford.edu/). I speak intermediate German and was a [Ruhr Fellow](https://www.northamerica.uaruhr.de/nyc/offers/ruhrfellowship.html.en). 

I switched to CS in order to become a better science fiction writer. I strongly identify with my best characters: a fictional character (in my fiction!) that uses calligraphy to bring humans into existence, and a human imprisoned in a computer that spearheads the AI Consciousness Movement. 

For a fun read, check out my thesis on [science fiction films' religious critique of androids and capitalism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQ_1Kn-7BNHuzPLhZ3iB0iwZb9esrRF_aMzJKcUW-Dk/edit).

2024 update: 
Being a foreign national in the US is, as I have learned in the past year, like a triathlon for life. You have to strive to be exceptional and also somehow stay happy and healthy. Your status binds you to extra choices and commitments. Paradoxically, while you’re trying to change and grow, the policy allows you much less flexibility to do so, which is extremely uncomfortable for someone whose entire identity is **becoming**. No advocacy tool I learned can fix the fact that I cannot live my life to the fullest, but I still try. I’ve seen this happen to the best of us over and over again. So if you’re also going through it, here’s an air hug <3
