We present PolyPoD, a new algorithm for seed placement. Given a polygonal farm boundary, number and types of seeds, PolyPoD generates the variable radius poisson disk distribution to compute viable seed placements. Results suggest that PolyPoD does better than our previous seed placement algorithm in avoiding over-competition, utilization of space, and plant segmentation.
