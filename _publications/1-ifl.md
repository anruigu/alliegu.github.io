In this work, we propose addressing both multimodality and distribution shift with Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning (IIFL), the first extension of implicit policies to interactive imitation learning (including the single-robot, single-human setting). It achieves 4.5x higher return on human effort in simulation experiments and an 80% higher success rate in a physical block pushing task over (Explicit) IFL, IBC, and other baselines when human supervision is heterogeneous.
